 * ---------------------Welcome to Thinking Tank ------------------------
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 


 * This is a simple game which will make your brains work !!!
 * well I and my team will try our best to match the hype 
 * Thanks a lot for going through the source code.
 * 
 * Just a brief explanation to the Module Structure and break down :
 *      1) Packages Hierarchy -
 *              Well I'm at the beginning of Expert Programmer for Python and OOPS
 *              so I have taken the liberty of skipping Inheritance among the classes.
 *		that is where I could skip inheritance. There are some method overrides
 *              but its pyglet not me!!!. Im just using it.
 * 

	This game uses Pyglet -- a simpler version of OpenGl for python.
